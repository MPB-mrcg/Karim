1. Infering IBD

The Run_isoRelate.sh is the main function when infering IBD segments between pairs of isolates. It calls several functions
which were adapted from https://github.com/bahlolab/isoRelate. 

2. Connectivity lines
To get GPS coordinates of the curved line used to connect 2 locations on a map, use the Get_Line_connector.R function.
It makes use of a Python script adapted from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-total-ellipse-on-the-map-9e30d5235078/.
